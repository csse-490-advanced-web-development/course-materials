# Lab 1: Photo Processing App

## Learning Goals / Objectives:

* Practice deploying an application
* Practice applying the steps we used last time (clone, push, deploy, etc) without instructions that are quite as explicit
* Practice using tests to guide your implementation
* Practice reading library documentation and using that reading to implement new things
* Practice a little creativity, too!

## Requirements:

* Your application must be deployed to Heroku
* Your application must accept an uploaded image and return a version of that image that has one or more effects applied to it via. [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
* Your work must be developed using the provided unit tests

## Getting Started:

Lab Starting Code (through GitHub Classroom): _link_


### 1. Clone the code
### 2. Install dependencies
### 3. Run the application in development mode
### 4. Run the tests
 // TODO

### 5. Follow the instructions in the test to implement the photo transformation(s) of your choice
 // TODO

### Step 5: Commit your local changes
### Step 6: Push your code to *your* GitHub repository
### Step 7: Deploy your code to Heroku
### Step 8: Make sure that your changes are live in production
### Step 9: Turn in the lab

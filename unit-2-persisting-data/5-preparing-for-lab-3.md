# Today's Agenda:

* Let's talk React
* Milestone 4
* Milestone 5

## Lab 4:

* Challenges?
  * Breaking up the state
    * Lifting up state, and sending functions/props back down
  * Figuring out some of the differences between regular HTML and React (JSX)
  * Mocks didn't include the validations!
  * Generally very slow via WSL2 and doesn't actually reload when you edit anything (Eliza to look into)
  * strict-mode forces you into a functional style (without as many warning messages as we would like)
* Questions?
  * Similar-but-not-the same components:  How?
* Observations?
